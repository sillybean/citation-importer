Import a citation or bibliography as posts.

## Description
The WordPress Citation Importer plugin imports individual citations, bibliography lists, or lists of DOIs into the WordPress publication database. You may choose which post type to use as the destination. Some custom fields and a taxonomy are specified, but can be filtered (as can the post fields themselves).

The plugin uses the [CrossRef Metadata API](http://search.crossref.org/help/api) to retrieve complete publication information using the citation as a search query.
